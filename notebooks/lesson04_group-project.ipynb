    "## A guide to structuring your group projects\n",
    "\n",
    "_Summary:_ In your group projects you will solve a data science problem end-to-end, pretending to be recently hired data scientists in a company.  To help you get started, we've prepared a checklist to guide you through the project. Here are the main steps that you will go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture\n",
    "2. Get the data\n",
    "3. Explore and visualise the data to gain insights\n",
    "4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms\n",
    "5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones\n",
    "6. Fine-tune your models\n",
    "7. Present your solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step we list a set of questions that one should have in mind when undertaking a data science project. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but does contain a selection of the most important questions to ask. We will be available to provide assitance with each of the steps, and will allocate some part of each lesson towards working on the projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline the grading, your group must submit a _**single**_ Jupyter notebook, structured in terms of the first 6 sections listed in this guide (the seventh will be presented to the class). You are welcome to adapt code from the web (e.g. Kaggle kernels), but you **_must_** reference the original source in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to _clean, well-documented code_ (i.e. functions with docstrings etc), your notebook will be judged according to how well each step is explained (using Markdown). The main goal is to simulate what it is like to work as a data scientist, where communication is arguably as important as the ability to extract insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in the Jupyter notebook will be evaluated according to a rubric similar to the assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Critical Task | Needs Improvement | Basic | Surpassed |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Computation:** Perform computations | Computations contain errors and extraneous code | Computations are correct but contain extraneous/unnecessary computations | Computations are correct and properly identified and labeled |\n",
    "| **Analysis:** Choose and carry out analysis appropriate for data and context | Choice of analysis is overly simplistic, irrelevant, or missing key components | Analysis appropriate, but incomplete, or important features and assumptions not made explicit | Analysis appropriate, complete, advanced, relevant, and informative |\n",
    "| **Synthesis:** Identify key features of the analysis, and interpret results (including context) | Conclusions are missing, incorrect, or not made based on results of analysis | Conclusions reasonable, but is partially correct or partially complete | Make relevant conclusions explicitly connected to analysis and to context |\n",
    "| **Visual presentation:** Communicate findings graphically clearly, precisely, and concisely | Inappropriate choice of plots; poorly labeled plots; plots missing | Plots convey information correctly but lack context for interpretation | Plots convey information correctly with adequate/appropriate reference information |\n",
    "| **Written:** Communicate findings clearly, precisely, and concisely | Explanation is illogical, incorrect, or incoherent | Explanation is partially correct but incomplete or unconvincing | Explanation is correct, complete, and convincing |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading split:** The group project accounts for 50% of the final grading and is split equally between the notebook (25%) and the presentation (25%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission deadline:** Thursday, May 28, 2020 before 23:59:59 CEST (Notebook + presentation recording)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presentation date:** Thursday, June 4, 2020 (Discussion of group projects with questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "The teams have to submit two deliverables before the submission deadline: 1) a notebook and 2) presentation video.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook\n",
    "The notebook contains all the code to explore the dataset, train the final model and documents each step clearly. If code is copied from another codebase such as Github or Stack Overflow it **_must_** be properly referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Presentation\n",
    "The presentation video should be 15min long and should highlight the problem you are solving, interesting things you found in the data and the step involved in building up your model. On the presentation date we will discuss the presentation and ask questions about your project and submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some examples\n",
    "The Kaggle competitions [page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) has hundreds of examples where people have applied machine learning to solve a variety of problems. Below are a few examples that you might find useful:\n",

    "The dataset for the competition consists of a regression problem for music popularity. The data was scraped from the Spotify API and contains several features, such as the name of the song and how much accoustics is used in the song. In total there are 17 features in the dataset. The target for the competition is to predict the popularity of a song from these features. In total, the dataset contains 130'326 samples which are split into a train (9/10) and test (1/10) sets. The training data contains the feature a and label columns whereas the test set only contains the feature columns. The goal of the competition is to train a model on the training set and then use this model to predict the labels on the test set. A more detailed description of the data is available on the competition website.\n",

    "The competition is organized as a Kaggle challenge. The data is available on the Kaggle page and you have to upload you model predictions on the Kaggle page. Your results will automatically be evaluated and you will see your scores as well as the scores of the other teams on the leaderboard. Note that the test set is split into two parts: 70% is used to evaluate your predictions every time you upload them. The remaining 30% of the test set are not evaluated until the competition finishes and is used to calculate the final score. This split aims at avoiding teams improving overfitting their models to the test set score. The number of team submissions per day are limited to **20**. Therefore, make sure you distribute the work such that you can evaluate all your ideas during the competition.\n",

Upload your submission in the dialog and add a short description of the steps that led these particular descriptions. After a few minutes you should see your score under  `My submissions` and if its your best run also on the `Leaderboard`."
